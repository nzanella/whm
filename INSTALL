Warehouse Manager Installation Instructions
===========================================

Requirements:
=============

The current version of Warehouse Manager can be compiled for both Linux
and Windows platforms with some effort. In either case the following are
required to compile the current version of Warehouse Manager:

- A C compiler (e.g. GNU g++ on Linux or MS Visual Studio on Windows)
- GTK+ 2.0 development libraries.
- libglade library (version 0.17 or later recommended)
- libgda (version 1.0.4 recommended, although later stable releases may work)

Note that the Warehouse Manager source code also makes use of libxml, but
this is not listed in the requirements as it is a prerequisite for libglade.

Installation Instructions:
==========================

- Ensure all required libraries are available on your system, otherwise
  download them and install them.

- Unpack the archive, since you are reading this, presumably you have
  already taken this step, but for completeness:

  $ tar -zxvf whm-x.y.z.tar.gz where x.y.z is the version number

- Change to the whm directory.

  $ cd whm

- Issue a make command in the top-level directory to build everything:

  $ make

- Become root and issue a make install:

  $ su -
  # make install

Your're done (well, almost). There is also a "make rpminstall" option which you
can issue as root to build an RPM package and automatically install from there.

Postinstallation Instructions:
==============================

In order to use Warehouse Manager you must create a warehouse database. The way
in which you set up the database varies according to which RDBMS you are using.
Warehouse Manager is written to be compatible with a variety of databse servers
including Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. Here we cover PostgreSQL but
installation on other servers is similar.

The following assumes you are logged in as user johndoe. Substitute your real
username for johndoe in what follows. We also assume a Fedora Core 3 installation.
For other Linux distributions the setup procedure is similar. Prompts have been
preceded by the name of the Unix user which must issue the given commands.

johndoe $ su -
root # su postgres
root # /etc/init.d/postgresql start
Starting postgresql service:                               [  OK  ]
postgres $ createuser johndoe
(answer yes to all questions)
postgres $ logout
root # logout
johndoe $ createdb warehouse
johndoe $ psql warehouse
Welcome to psql 7.4.6, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help on internal slash commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

warehouse=# \i /usr/share/whm/data.sql
(database table creation details omitted)
warehouse=# \q

Running Instructions:
=====================

You are now ready to launch whm by either typing its name on the
command line or by launching it from the Gnome Startup menu.

Note: the databse server needs to be running for you to access tables etc...
      so make sure you start it either as root or configure your system to
      to make the database server start automatically when it boots up.
