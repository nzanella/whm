Warehouse Manager is a business application designed to allow you to
manage several aspects of your personal warehouse based enterprise from
your computer. Warehouse Manager provides you with a quick and easy way
to store and access your buiness data and use it to perform mission
critical decisions. If you are the manager of a warehouse based company
and are tired of some of the error prone burdens associated with manual
information management and decision making then Warehouse Manager is for
you.

    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2963956"></a>About this Manual</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

This User Manual describes how to use Warehouse Manager. It serves as a
means to describe the user interface and how to use it to accomplish
common tasks. This manual also describes the underlying assumptions
Warehouse Manager makes about the underlying data model. You may
want to read through the manual to familiarize yourself with
Warehouse Manager and exploit its capabilities to their
fullest.

    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2904237"></a>Using the Software Product</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Warehouse Manager has been designed with the user in mind and care has been
taken to make the application as user friendly as possible. With Warehouse
Manager you will never have to key in the same data twice. Warehouse Manager
stores your data in a database and presents it to you whenever you need to
access it so you don't even have to remember it.

Warehouse Manager consists of several screens each allowing you to carry
out a set of related taks. Each screen presents a logical view of some
portion of data held in the database and consists of one or more tables,
input widgets, and buttons, altogether allowing you to carry out data
selection and manipulation. In most cases data is selected by clicking
on the corresponding table rows. In the case where data is being
selected from a popup window the selection is completed by clicking on
the corresponding done push button. Usually when data is selected from a
table it is also displayed in more detail on nearby widgets displaying
dates, numeric data, lines of text, or other information. On most
screens buttons allowing the user to add, modify, or delete can also be
found. These buttons allow the user to initiate the specified action.
For modification and deletion though, it is necessary to select the
appropriate row to be modified or deleted first. When manipulating data
it is important that you complete (or cancel) each action by clicking on
the appropriate submit or cancel push button provided for this purpose.

    </p><p>

Currently the user interface implementation is comprised of several
components the most obvious being a menu bar and a tab widget. The
menu bar is where basic tasks such as connecting to a particular
database or reading this manual can be found. The tab widget is
used to select among one of twelve main screens each of which
may involve subscreens and subselection popup windows.
The twelve screens are named Inventory, Customers, Representatives,
Suppliers, Sales, Sold Items, Purchases, Purchased Items, Containers,
Categories, Item Catalogue, and History. Their purpose and workings
are described in the following sections. To speed things up you
may wish to use the tab key to move the input focus from widget
to widget. When the tab widget has the input focus you may use
the right and left arrow keys to move from one main screen to
another. Similarly whenever a table has the input focus you
may use the up and down keys to select data. Furthermore
enabled tables may be sorted according to the fields
appearing in their headers by clicking on them.

    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2904292"></a>Suppliers, Representatives, and Customers</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

This software product assumes items coming from suppliers first enter and then
exit the warehouse at a later time as representatives sell them to customers.
Given these premises Warehouse Manager allows you to manage personal
information pertaining to these three entities.

    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2904306"></a>Accessing and Manipulating Data</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Warehouse Manager allows you to access contact information with a simple
tab widget selection and table row selection. You may simply click on the
table presented to you on the left hand side and scroll down to the record
of interest. Warehouse Manager will present on the left hand side of the
screen complete information pertaining to the selected entity. The same
screen is also used to manipulate data. As mentioned earlier, once this
information is entered you will not have to enter it ever again on other
screens as such information will be automatically extracted from the
database and presented to you by the application on screens where
such information is required. This approach makes the overall
process of data management is thus made less error prone
across the application while enforcing constraints which
allow the data in your database to be consistent and
thus suitable for being analyzed at a later time.

      </p><p>

The process of adding, modifying, or deleting a record
on each of the Suppliers, Representatives, and Customers
screens is similar so these operations will be described
for Suppliers. To add a supplier, simply click Add, and
key in all mandatory fields and whichever optional fields
you wish. The Submit push button will become enabled when
the application is ready to accept the entered information.
Click it to complete the operation. Modifying and Deleting
are analogous, except you must select the desired record to
be modified or deleted from the corresponding data table first.

      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903433"></a>Suppliers Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Suppliers are identified by supplier name. Hence it is not possible to
add or modify suppliers in such a way that the added or modified
supplier name matches that of an existing supplier.
Removal of a supplier implies removal of all brand and items associated
with such supplier and removal of all container categories and containers
associated with such supplier. However, such operation is not permitted
in the case where purchases from the given supplier have been made. In
particular no nonempty containers associated with a given supplier can
ever be discarded by the application. This is because nonemptyness of
a given container implies the existence of a purchase from the given
supplier which prevents deletion of the given supplier, hence
preventing deletion of nonempty containers. Removal of a
supplier whose items participate in sales to customers
is also not permitted.

      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903458"></a>Customers Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Customers are identified by customer name. Hence it is not possible to
add or modify customers in such a way that the added or modified
customer name matches that of an existing customer.
Removal of a customer to which merchandise has been sold is not permitted.

      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903472"></a>Representatives Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Representatives are identified by representative ID. Hence it is not possible to
add or modify representatives in such a way that the added or modified
representative ID matches that of an existing representative.
Removal of a representative which has participated in sales
is not permitted.

      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2903489"></a>Item Catalogue</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

The Item Catalogue screen allows you to define items which
are being considered for future purchase from suppliers and
provides a means to introduce items to the application. The
user may wish to either add items prior to their purchase
using this screen or add them as they are being purchased
from the Purchases screen. In the latter case, the
application will automatically add the purchased
items to the item catalogue.

    </p><p>

The Item Catalogue screen implements three master detail data tables.
Selecting a supplier allows the user to access information pertaining
to all brands related to that particular supplier. Once supplier and
brand are selected the user may access information about all items
pertaining to that particular supplier and brand.

    </p><p>

The supplier information entered in the Item Catalogue screen consists
of the supplier name alone. Once a supplier name is entered in the
supplier catalogue an entry is added to the Suppliers screen so
that the user may entered more detailed information pertaining
to such supplier at a later time if desired.

    </p><p>

The user may associate a prospective sales item price with each item
made known to the application. This represents the advertised customer
price to be told to customers as they inquire about particular items.
The user may wish to either enter such information as items are being
defined or ignore it and modify it at a later time if needed.

    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2905775"></a>Item Catalogue Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Suppliers are identified by supplier name. Brands are identified by
supplier name and supplier brand. Items are identified by supplier
name, supplier brand, and item code. The usual restrictions to
adding and modifying these entities apply. That is, no two
supplier names may be identical, no two combinations of
supplier name and brand may be identical, and no two
combinations of supplier name, supplier brand, and
item code may be identical. Nevertheless, it is
acceptable for two distinct suppliers to have
identical brands, or even for two distinct
brands to have identical item codes.

      </p><p>

Removal of a supplier implies removal of all brand and items associated
with such supplier and removal of all container categories and containers
associated with such supplier. However, such operation is not permitted
in the case where purchases from the given supplier have been made. In
particular no nonempty containers associated with a given supplier can
ever be discarded by the application. This is because nonemptyness of
a given container implies the existence of a purchase from the given
supplier which prevents deletion of the given supplier, hence
preventing deletion of nonempty containers. Removal of a
supplier whose items participate in sales to customers
is also not permitted.

      </p><p>

Removal of a brand implies removal of all items associated with corresponding
supplier and brand and removal of all container categories and containers
associated with such supplier and brand. However, such operation is not
permitted in the case where purchases from the given supplier with given brand
have been made. In particular no nonempty containers associated with a
given supplier and brand can ever be discarded by the application. This
is because nonemptyness of a given container implies the existence of a
purchase from the given supplier with given brand which prevents deletion
of the given brand, hence preventing deletion of nonempty containers.
Removal of a supplier brand with associated items participating in
sales is also not permitted.

      </p><p>

Removal of an item code is not permitted in the case where purchases
from the given supplier with given brand and item code have been made.
In particular no nonempty containers associated with a given supplier,
brand, and item code can ever be discarded by the application. This
is because nonemptyness of a given container implies the existence of
a purchase from the given supplier with given brand and item code which
prevents deletion of the given item code, hence preventing deletion
of nonempty containers. Removal of an item which participates in
sales is also not permitted.

      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2905850"></a>Purchases</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

The Purchases screen allows you to keep track of purchases. The action of
receiving items purchased from suppliers or returning damaged items to
suppliers are carried out independently on the Purchased Items screen.
Neither do suppliers need be defined in the Suppliers screen, nor do
items need be defined in the Item Catalogue screen prior to items
being purchased. Entries for these will be added to the appropriate
screens by the application as purchases are carried out from
the Purchases screen.

    </p><p>

To carry out a purchase, click on the Add push button and enter the date,
supplier name, order number, and an optional order description. The supplier
name is entered via the popup window invoked by clicking on the button to the
right of the supplier name widget. The popup widget presents allows the user
to modify information pertaining to known supplier names, and finally select
the entry of interest by selecting it in the data table and clicking on the
done push button. As always, the user must click on the Submit push button
to complete the operation.

    </p><p>

Once a purchase is created, the user typically proceeds to adding items
to the given purchase using the screen on the right hand side. A popup
window is provided to select brand and item corresponding to the
supplier from which the purchase is being carried out. Purchase
items will appear in the purchased items data table. The user
may also choose to modify or cancel a purchase at a later time
which is made possible using the usual application controls.
Note that received items may not be deleted from the
Purchases screen.

    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2905893"></a>Purchases Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Purchases are identified by purchase number. Hence it is not possible to
add or modify purchases in such a way that the added or modified
purchase number matches that of an existing purchase. Removal of
a purchase implies removal of all items comprising such purchase
from the purhcase itself but not from the item catalogue. Removal
of a purchase with associated received items is not permitted.

      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903656"></a>Purchase Items Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Purchase items are identified by purchase number, supplier name,
supplier brand, and item code. Hence it is not possible to add
or modify such items in such a way that the added or modified
item has the same identifying information as an existing one.
Should the number of requested items of a given kind need to
be modified the change can be carried out by adjusting the
corresponding quantity field. Removal of an item from a
given purchase is not permitted in the case where some
quantity of the given item has already been received.

      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2903675"></a>Purchased Items</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Once purchases have been filed items may arrive from suppliers and must be
unpacked so that they may be stored in the warehouse inventory. This happens
when items from pending orders are received. Unpacked items which have not
yet been stored in warehouse containers are considered to be loose and can
be stored separately from the Containers screen. The Purchased Items screen
is used to record when items are received from suppliers. The Purchased Items
screen is also used to ship damaged items back to the supplier. The application
assumes that all damaged items result from customer returns. In order to ship
an item back to a supplier the user must first ensure that enough damaged
items exist in the warehouse.

    </p><p>

The application groups items received as part of supplier purchases by date.
Hence if more than one parcel arrives with items from the same order on the
same date, the user will have to click on the Modify push button to adjust
the number of received items coming from a particular purchase as they
are received.

    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903705"></a>Received Purchased Items Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

The event of receiving some quantity of a purchased item is identified
by date received, purchase number, supplier name, supplier brand, and
item code. Hence it is not possible to add or modify such events in
such a way that the added or modified event has the same identifying
information as an existing one.

      </p><p>

Should the number of items received on a particular date corresponding
to a given event need to be modified the change can be carried out by
adjusting the corresponding quantity field. Removal or modification
of such an event is not permitted in the case where the number of
loose items is less that the modified or deleted number of
corresponding items received according to the given event.

      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903731"></a>Sent Purchased Items Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

The event of sending some quantity of a purchased item is identified
by date received, purchase number, supplier name, supplier brand, and
item code. Hence it is not possible to add or modify such events in
such a way that the added or modified event has the same identifying
information as an existing one.

      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2903747"></a>Container Categories and Tax Categories</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

The application assumes that the warehouse is comprised of a bunch
of containers, each of which falls into one of several user defined
categories. Such categories can be set up from the Categories screen.
It is also assumed that each category is identified by a unique user
specified ID and references a unique product supplier and brand. Each
category also references one or more user defined tax categories
consisting of a tax category description and tax category percentage.
Tax categories are used for classifying merchandise according to
expenses associated with products crossing national borders.

    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903767"></a>Container Categories Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Container Categories are identified by category ID. Hence it is not
possible to add or modify container categories in such a way that
the added or modified container category ID matches that of an
existing tax category. Removal of a container category such
that nonempty containers associated with such tax category
exist is not permitted. On the other hand removal of a
container category implies removal of all
necessarily empty containers associated
with such tax category.

      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903784"></a>Tax Categories Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Tax Categories are identified by category description. Hence it is not
possible to add or modify tax categories in such a way that the added
or modified category description matches that of an existing tax
category. Removal of a tax category which is part of a container
category is not permitted.

      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2903801"></a>Containers</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Merchandise is sold from warehouse containers. In the case of items being
sold prior to them being available in the warehouse, an empty container for
such items needs to be defined so that representatives may sell the merchandise
according to container category and container number. The Containers screen allows
you to decide which items must go inside which containers. Each container will contain
one type of item. However, at a later time you may decide that a given container may
contain items of a different kind. This operation is possible since when an item is
sold, the application records along with the current category ID and container number
also the supplier name, brand, and item code of the item being sold. Thus should the
category ID and container number be used at a later time to store a different kind
of item it is still possible to find out what item was requested by the customer.
Hence ombinations of container item and container number may be reused over time
as desired.

    </p><p>

To add a container, you must first click on the Add push button. Then
you must select an appropriate container item from the items table on
the top right hand side. Tax categories matching the selected supplier
and brand combination will be displayed on the bottom right hand side
table and the user must select one of these. In case any of the two
tables on the right hand side happens to be empty or not contain
the desired data, the user will have to first add such data from
the corresponding Items and Categories table. Once a selection
exists in both tables you must specifiy a container number and
the number of items to move to the container. The table on the
left hand side will be then updated upon clicking the Submit
push button.

    </p><p>

The Available field of the table on the left hand side represents
the number of items of a given kind which have arrived at the warehouse
but have not yet been stored in their appropriate warehouse containers.
The number of items stored cannot exceed the number of available itmes.
Upon modification and removal of items from containers the corresponding
number of available loose items is updated. This step is usually only
necessary when items need be returned to the supplier.

    </p><p>

The user should note that the quantity field may be zero at container
creation in case the user needs to define a category for ordered items
which have not yet arrived and wants to have representative sell them
using preassigned container category and container number. This
operation can be carried out from the Sales screen. Note that
as expected, the user will not be able to record shipment of
items to customers unless they are first present in their
respective containers. Shush shipment is carried out from
the Sold Items screen.

    </p><p>

Finally, it is assumed that the warehouse is initially empty. Should
this not be the case, in the worse of all circumstances it is always
possible to add a phony supplier and a phony order containing everything
in the warehouse, so as to initialize the warehouse contents.

    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2903891"></a>Containers Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Containers are identified by category ID and container number. Hence it
is not possible to add or modify containers in such a way that the added
or modified container ID and container number matches that of an existing
container. Each container identifies one kind of item from the Item Catalogue
as well as one kind of container category. Hence items added to such containers
must necessarily match in supplier name, supplier brand, and item code. Removal
of a container which contains items implies loosening all items stored within
that container prior to container disposal.

      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2903912"></a>Sales</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

The Purchases and Sales screens have similar user interfaces. While items
need not be defined in the Items screen prior to their purchase, appropriate
containers must be set up in the Containers screen prior to the sale of items
described therein to take place. Items may even be sold from empty containers.
In either case, merchandise will need to be loosened from the appropriate
containers prior to it being shipped to customers. No items may be
shipped to customers until they are available in the warehouse.
The process of shipping items to customers is recorded from the
Sold Items window.

    </p><p>

Representatives need not be defined in the Representatives screen
prior to sales taking place. However complete information pertaining
to a given representative may only be edited from the Representatives
screen and not from the sales screen.

    </p><p>

To carry out a sale, first complete the date, sale ID, sale representative,
and customer information. The representative and customer must be entered
via their respective popup forms which can be seen when the push buttons
to the right of the widgets to be filled in by the application are clicked.
In these popup forms, the user typically selects the appropriate field by choosing
the corresponding table row and clicks the done button. Once a sale is created,
the user proceeds to add items to the given sale using the screen on the right
hand side. A popup window is provided to select supplier, brand, and item.
Only those items which have been registered with a given container will
show up.

    </p><p>

In case the user decides to modify or cancel a sale
at a later time this is also possible using the usual
application controls, just as in the purchases screen.

    </p><p>

Note that recording a particular sale does not imply immediate
recepit or shipment of items. Pending items will be queued and
the user must record corresponding shipments through the
Sold Items screen.

    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2902557"></a>Sales Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Sales are identified by sale number. Hence it is not possible to
add or modify sales in such a way that the added or modified
sale number matches that of an existing sale. Removal of a
sale with associated sent items is not permitted.

      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2902571"></a>Sale Items Constraints</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Sale items are identified by sale number, supplier name,
supplier brand, and item code. Hence it is not possible to add
or modify such items in such a way that the added or modified
item has the same identifying information as an existing one.
Should the number of requested items of a given kind need to
be modified the change can be carried out by adjusting the
corresponding quantity field. Removal of an item from a
given sale is not permitted in the case where some
quantity of the given item has already been sent.

      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2902591"></a>Receiving and Shipping Customer and Supplier Items</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>

The Sold Items screens are used to record the sending of sold items to 
customers as well as the receiving of damaged items from customers.
The user may select among these two screens using the provided
combo box situated under the tab widget.

    </p><p>

Items must be available as loose items in order to be sent. However
in order to cater to those situations where an ordered item is sold
out or no longer being produced at the supplier site, the application
makes it possible to substitute specific quantities of ordered items
with substituted items, which, must be available as loose items in
the warehouse. In such cases the sold items are recorded as
being satisfied and the number of substitute items specified
is decremented from the warehouse inventory.

    </p><p>

When the customer sends an item to the warehouse, the application is
able to allow the user select whether the sent item was the original
one or whether it was a replacement in which case the user must select
the item it was supposed to replace. In either case the number of
replaced items received is added to the warehouse and the number
of satisfied items of the substituted type is decremented.

The Inventory window gives you a broad view of the current state of the warehouse, including
all items from the item catalogue independently of whether any reside in the warehouse, all
containers and their associated category information regardless of whether such containers
contain any items, advertized price to be announced to interested customers, average
purchase and sale prices of items over the entire history of the warehouse, how many
good items are in stock, and how many damaged items are in stock. Concerning good
items, the application also displays how many are loose and how many have been
stored in containers. Furthermore, the incoming and outgoing fields can be
used to check how many purchased items yet have to be received, and how
many sold items yet have to be sent.

As the user selects rows from the item table, two other tables update themselves to
display all orders of the given items which have been carried out, including a breakdown
of which customers await which orders. Thus when items are received the user can decide
how to distribute the received items among customers waiting for them. The user can
also gain some appreciation of the popularity of an item by looking at these windows
comparing date and quantity information.

The History view allows you to inspect the state of the warehouse
on any given date. Click on the Take Snapshot button to record the
state of the warehouse on the current date. It is recommended that
this is done as frequently as possible, ideally on a daily basis,
as this will add value to the application data thus enhancing
accuracy of data analusis. Closing the application using the
Exit menu option will automatically take a snapshot of the
current state of the warehouse.
